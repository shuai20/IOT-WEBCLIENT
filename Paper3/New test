This paper investigates the interdependent privacy issues among third-party application platforms. The widespread use of third-party applications has greatly facilitated user communication and collaboration, but has also brought complex privacy issues. Third-party application platforms use permission management mechanisms to explain to users how to access and transfer data, while expecting to use data flexibly within the scope of users' permission to enhance user experience. We observed some problems when we reviewed the mechanisms of creation and use of these permissions and found a particular type of permission. They were given a precise name based on previous research: interdependent privacy permissions. Here we give a brief description of such permissions.

The core mechanism of the permission system of the third-party application platform is that the system asks the user whether he/she agrees to transfer and process data within the scope of this permission description. Still, this mechanism cannot deal with the problem that the data owned by this user may involve others and does not have the authorization of others. For example, if the permission “access photos in your album” is obtained from the user, the system can reasonably obtain the data of the photos, even if they are related to the privacy of other users.

We developed scripts to obtain data from a number of third-party application platforms, including Google Play Store, Mozilla extension, Opera extension, Google Workspace and Zoom Marketplace. These data contain numerous different application categories, the number of users, ratings, and types of permissions requested from users.

We classify permissions into three pre-defined categories: invoking interdependent privacy (IDP), potentially invoking interdependent privacy (PIDP), and not invoking interdependent privacy(NIDP). If a permission directly enables access to private data related to a natural person other than the user herself, it is in IDP; e.g., the READ_CONTACTS permission in Android. If a permission potentially enables access to private data related to a natural person other than the user herself, it is in PIDP. Such risk can be realized through i) accessing data that may implicate multiple parties, such as photos or documents (e.g., READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE in Android); ii) enabling a restricted action that may create multi-party data, such as photos or audio recordings (e.g., RECORD_AUDIO in Android); and iii) enabling inference of other’s private data with reasonable effort, such as location via co-location information from other sources (e.g., ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION in Android). Note that granting a PIDP permission does not automatically constitute privacy loss
for a third party; the loss is context-dependent and may require additional effort
from the app developer or an adversary. If a permission does not belong either
to IDP or PIDP, then it is in NIDP, and not in our focus.

By analyzing these datasets, we found that each platform has many IDP permissions and many applications requesting IDP permissions. We also found that some applications in categories such as communication and business clearly request more permissions and IDP permissions from users.

The responsibility for mitigating Interdependent privacy risks should not be borne by the user, from the perspective of the platform, application and service provider, according to the 3R principle (realize there is a data transfer, realize others' rights and respect others' rights), a brief description of some potential solutions is given here.

Transparency: The first two aspects can be started from transparency, by classifying and describing permissions in detail, such as classifying permissions into IDP/PIDP/NIDP, improving users' awareness of the interdependence of data. We notice that Zoom Marketplace's permission system has done this to some extent, they classify permissions as " Associated with you" and "Associated with you and others you're allowed to access", which allows users to realize that the data is only about themselves or about others. We did not find such descriptions explicit in the permission systems of other platforms.

Risk avoidance: After giving a specific description of the scope of the permission, the platform should give the user the right to disable the permission, even if disabling certain permissions will cause damage to the user experience, the platform and the application need to provide their own solutions to such problems. So far, many third-party application platforms adopt the mechanism of “all or nothing”, i.e., the user agrees to grant the application permission, then install and use it; or not use it.

Control: For risks arising from certain IDP issues, it is difficult to solve only by a simple permission system, many mature technologies, such as image recognition and text matching, can provide some technical solutions, for example, image recognition can filter out the private information involving others when users share picture information.
